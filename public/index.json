We will discuss concepts and terminology related to data and data solutions. You will learn the fundamentals of computer science with “drag \u0026amp; drop blocks”. In order to become acquainted with the basic computational concepts of problem-solving, logical thinking, cause and effect within the context of modelling, you will be introduced to prime programming operations, control structures, data types, etc. We will finish by configuring your working environment and installing the software necessary when working on your future data projects.\nWhat you will learn:\n To describe forms, formats, and lifecycles of data and how these vary across disciplines To represent programming logic in pseudocode and/or flowcharts Basic concepts such as data type and index To use Boolean expressions in if-then structures for making decisions To use looping structures and how to end loops To create your own customised functions To install and run R/RStudio  Unit 2 R in RStudio: syntax and working environment\nIn this module you will set up the working environment and pass the first big hurdle of importing data; you will learn how to do it the proper way with a command in R. You will learn how to use RStudio IDE for R from RStudio customisation to files navigation. You will learn good habits and practice of workflow in an R project. Once you get comfortable with the RStudio working environment, you will move on to mastering the key features of R language and its syntax.\nWhat you will learn:\n Basic use of R/RStudio console Good habits for workflow Data structures, variables, and basic data collection techniques Inputting and importing different data types R environment: record keeping  Unit 3 Git in GitHub: Basic Shell Script\nVersion control has become an essential tool for keeping track when working on data projects, as well as collaborating. RStudio supports working with Git, an open source distributed version control system, which is easy to use when combined with GitHub, a web-based Git repository hosting service. In this unit you will expand your data working environment, install Git and connect to GitHub through RStudio. You will learn how to use git to track changes to your work over time, and how to “branch” your project into a separate copy that can be developed further in isolation from the main code or merged back into the main trunk. You will discover why GitHub is useful for reproducible analysis and collaboration with others.\nWhat you will learn:\n To explain the difference between Git and GitHub To communicate with others on GitHub To create a new and clone an existing repository on GitHub To use the shell commands to do basic version control with Git To fork, branch and collaborate using GitHub Good habits and practice of integrating Git and GitHub into your R project workflow  Unit 4 Basic Statistical Concepts: Data classification, summary statistics and DA Methodology\nNow, as you become more comfortable with the RStudio working environment, you will move on to mastering the key features of R language through the introduction of the fundamental statistical concepts. In this module you will learn the fundamental concepts of statistical modelling, starting with exploring the data by using appropriate plots and computation of descriptive statistics, and moving on to inferential statistics of parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. You will learn the process of generating conclusions about a population from a noisy sample. Using statistical inference through the navigation of the set of assumptions and tools, you will learn how to draw conclusions from data to generate new knowledge.\nWhat you will learn:\n The concept of statistical distribution How to explore and visualise different data types using base R How to adopt common data-analysis methodology when exploring relationships within data The basics of inferential statistics by making valid generalizations from sample data Basic tools for making statistical inference Conduct explorative data analysis, interpret and report its outcomes in an appropriate manner  Unit 5 Data Wrangling\nIn this unit you will learn some of the fundamental techniques for data exploration and transformation through the use of the dplyr package. This tidyverse package helps make your exploration intuitive to write and easy to read. You will learn dplyr’s key verbs for data manipulation that will help you uncover and shape the information within the data that is easy to turn into informative plots.\nWhat you will learn:\n dplyr’s key data manipulation verbs: select, mutate, filter, arrange and summarise/summarize To aggregate data by groups To chain data manipulation operations using the pipe operator To create summary statistics for a dataset  Unit 6 Data Visualisation\nIn this unit you will be introduced to the fundamental principles behind effective data visualisation. Through the use of the grammar of graphics plotting concepts implemented in the ggplot2 package, you will be able to create meaningful exploratory plots. You will develop understanding about the way in which you should be able to think about necessary data transformations and summaries that can lead to an informative visualisation. You will learn how to create static maps and interactive maps with geolocated data by using the most popular packages in the R GIS community: simple features (sf) and leaflet.\nWhat you will learn:\n Basic principles of effective data visualisation To specify ggplot2 building blocks and combine them to create a graphical display About the philosophy that guides ggplot2: grammatical elements (layers) and aesthetic mapping To visualise data with maps  Unit 7 Reproducible Reporting\nThis unit will give you an appreciation of R programming as a tool for reproducible reporting. Adopting and applying open and transparent approaches to your DS project is integral to genuinely rigorous analysis and adds to the material value of one’s work. In view of this, the presentation of the available code, data and algorithms should be available to scrutiny and possible connectivity to the wider DS community. R Markdown and knitr make it easy to intermingle code and text to generate compelling reports and presentations that are never out of date.\nWhat you will learn\n Store in one place your data analysis methods, results and interpretation Update your data analysis methodology and automate the update of the results Write your DS report text and code in R Markdown Generate reproducible DS reports that display your code and results Assemble your DS reporting as either HTML, a PDF or a Word document using the package rmarkdown  Unit 8 Case Study\nThis unit provides much needed hands-on experience. You will work on a on a real-life data problem that involves a complete data analysis, from data import to communication of results, with emphasis on reproducibility and transparency. You will develop you project openly on GitHub and make contributions to your fellow student whom you will communicate via GitHub Issues and who will review it and accepted it.\nWhat you will learn\n To integrate different aspects of DS knowledge and skills To collaborate with others when working on a DS project To gain exposure to an open source development process To build personal DS portfolios  ","date":1623193200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1623193200,"objectID":"7f4a8af44f319d33ea4f03cae8ef573f","permalink":"/courses/example/syllabus/","publishdate":"2021-06-09T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/courses/example/syllabus/","section":"courses","summary":"Learning units build on previous units and they should be learnt in the order presented.\nUnit 1 Core DS/AI Concepts and Tools\nThis unit will cover the baseline knowledge you need before getting into the advanced coding aspects of DS/AI.","tags":null,"title":"Indicative Syllabus","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The goal of the mentoring programme is to guide and help the candidates to complete this course and to inspire, invigorate and assist the candidates. By taking practical steps we keep them moving in the direction of becoming data empowered professionals. Based on the candidates’ experiences we assign mentors who will guide and support them to develop the necessary skills and to gain practical project experience. Together they will create a friendly, safe, and confidential environment for communication and informal discussions. The programme lasts six months and goes through four key stages:\n Stage 1: Getting to know one another and explore areas where the mentee may need support Stage 2: Moving forward in helping the mentee identify their needs and finding the ways in which the mentor can help Stage 3: Developing a mentoring strategy for achieving the set goals Stage 4: Reviewing the progression of the mentoring plan and reflecting on what has been achieved  Through this mentoring programme, we will expose many candidates to data related practices and help them to nurture their interest in applying these practices to their everyday work.\nOur mentoring programme aims to be inclusive; we are the antithesis of exclusivity, we believe in active engagement, knowledge acquisition and building skills for future goals and milestones.\nGuide The Mentoring Programme plan will serve as a framework and roadmap to identify its priorities and to designate roles, responsibilities, and criteria for meeting those priorities. The programme plan will provide a systematic process to carry out the mission of providing lifelong, blended learning and developmental opportunities for our candidates.\nBroad roles and responsibilities A good working relationship requires respect, self-awareness, inclusion, open communication and trust.\nMentor Our mentor motivates their mentees to do their best work and take steps that will help career advancement using data skills. Through discussions a mentor identifies needs, assimilates the mentee into the wider data driven community, and assists them in developing short- and long-term goals. Thanks to being able to give back to the community the mentor benefits from this relationship in the form of personal satisfaction. It enables the mentor to build a legacy of knowledge, gain new insight and experience whilst enhancing visibility and prestige.\nA mentor shall provide:\n Insight, constructive feedback and encouragement A safe environment for taking actions Agreed-upon commitment of time  Mentee A mentee should be committed to professional growth and should be driven to succeed. A mentee should acknowledge the time and effort that the mentor puts into providing support and establishing a relationship. They can do this by showing a willingness to take the initiative in asking relevant questions, responding to the provided feedback and by seeking new learning opportunities. A mentee benefits from this relationship by acquiring personal education and by gaining exposureand opportunities for advancement within the DS and AI community. In this way a mentee constructs a greater awareness of career and personal capabilities and possibilities.\nA mentee should be willing to:\n Assess his or her individual needs Take the initiative in skill and career development Participate in the mentoring relationship Develop and utilize the skills of professionalism  Establishing the Relationship Both sides, the mentor and mentee, should consider their intentions and expectations for the relationship before they even meet.\nMentor: first meeting To prepare for the first meeting, a mentor should:\n Summarize goals and expectations for the mentoring partnership List two to three topics to discuss with the mentee Consider the logistics of monthly meetings  Some of the questions a mentor can prepare for the first meeting might include:\n Can you tell me about your background and experience when working with data? What gives you the most satisfaction? Frustration? How do you like to spend your free time? Who do you admire the most or find the most interesting? Why? How do you use your data skills on the job? Which relevant data skills do you want to develop? How can I help? What attracted you to this programme? How often would you like to connect? Six months from now, how would you like to have grown as a result of this mentoring relationship? What one thing can I do to ensure a positive experience for you? What should I expect from you?  Mentee: first meeting To prepare for the first meeting, a mentee should:\n Consider goals and expectations for the mentoring partnership Consider the logistics and frequency of meetings Prepare talking points for introductory phone calls  Some of the questions a mentee can prepare for the first meeting might include:\n Have you had past successes in mentoring individuals? I’m seeking specific “xyz” skills for my professional development. Can you help me attain them? What expectations do you generally have of the people you mentor? How much time can you offer? How can I plan for our next meeting?  The first informational interview/meeting should result in the following outcomes:\n A decision. Do you want to enter into a mentoring partnership with this person? An answer. Does this person have the knowledge to help you define your goals and turn them into reality?  Follow up meetings Once the match has been made it is important that both the mentor and mentee take ownership of their participation in the programme and agree on:\n where and when the subsequent meetings will take place regularity of meetings methods of contact what would be achievable goals and objectives within the time scale of the programme, i.e. what happens next best practice in working towards the agreed aims and objectives  The mentor and mentee will determine the final mix of activities for the programme, but they should include:\n goal-setting documentation review feedback evaluation and closure  By its very nature, mentoring is rewarding and valuable for both sides involved. The sharing of knowledge, expertise and insight helps to create more motivated and accomplished professionals.\nRecognition and reward To acknowledge the work and effort required from all parties involved in this programme two events are planned. The events will serve to promote and publicise the success of the programme by encouraging both mentors and mentees to talk about their experience and showcase their achievements.\nResources used This guide is adapted from:\n Share.

The objective was to meet and work as a group as a means of establishing the Regional Network of Women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths). The Women in STEM Network aims to expand opportunities for girls and women in educational and workplace contexts within the Western Balkans, focussing on STEM related fields. Ingrained patriarchal values and traditional culture norms are hindrances to women’s empowerment and gender equality in the Western Balkans (WB) region. This group of women are determined to address and resolve this and any other obstacles to the progress and empowerment of women in STEM.\nThe impact of COVID-19 resulted in a significant step backwards to recent progress regarding the reduction of gender segregation within occupations and women’s under-employment. The unequal participation in domestic duties has disproportionately impacted on the economic actualities of working women. At the same time, during the COVID-19 crisis, companies have accelerated their digital transformation as a crucial strategy for survival and future success.\nAnalytics and automation are absolutely key to successful digital transformation for businesses of all sizes. The global pandemic, seismic in its impact, has both accelerated the need for robust transformation strategies and simultaneously highlighted the cracks and strains relating to gender employment.\nWe recognise that the life-blood of our network is STEM education as an integrated, interdisciplinary approach to learning that provides hands-on learning experiences for students and wider communities. We see STEM teaching and learning beyond the mere transfer of knowledge. It is a mechanism for initiating and equipping learners with critical thinking, problem solving, creative and collaborative skills. This mechanism ultimately establishes interconnected relationships between work places, schools and communities and regional economies.\nEven before the pandemic, organizations were struggling to recruit and retain people with the skills needed to help them succeed in a data-driven world. Part of the solution is to retrain current workforces into productive data analytic practitioners, which are closely STEM related. A person-centred approach is essential to success, as is infusing a culture of familiarity and expertise with data analytics overarching various organisations. Focussing on human-centred approaches makes data analytics accessible to a broader demographic, particularly women, which is now more than ever crucial in the current working environment.\nThroughout the pandemic it has become even more obvious that in order to gain a competitive advantage in a business environment, companies will have to provide an inclusive framework supporting work life balance and flexible work arrangements. By doing this, they will attract and retain a talented workforce and enhance women’s access to non-traditional jobs. It is very desirable to introduce certification for gender equality standards, to encourage and recognise commitment to advancing the careers of women in STEM. Certification showcases a company’s commitment to gender equality and transparency and helps to create a cultural perception of a more equal and fairer society in the region.\nWe all recognise that in addition to addressing the talent pipeline issue and encouraging more young women to pursue careers in STEM related fields, there is more that industry can and should do. We have an obligation to be mutually supportive; this is the first step in countering unconscious bias and genuinely empowering people. Difference is an accelerator of innovation.\nIt is now agreed that the Women in STEM Network is going to be based on a data driven framework with the principles of equity, partnership, and sustainability. The network will seek smart, scalable solutions that lead to removing barriers and creating equitable access and opportunities for historically underserved groups of women. Gender focus is at the heart of the process of developing new programs and initiating projects as a means of closing the gender gap. Our initiative seeks to develop mechanisms of support for women as they strive to become leaders, critical thinkers, and creators. The networks created will develop new programs, projects, funding opportunities and consequently create greater opportunities for gender minorities.\nThe core team of the network incorporates a representative from each country. Dr Tatjana Kecojevic is the lead representative for the Serbian National Women in STEM Network. Tatjana is a data scientist with a doctorate in Statistics from the University of Manchester. She spent many years working in the U.K. university sector as a senior lecturer and has published an extensive number of articles and papers relating to data analysis. Tatjana established the chapters of R-Ladies Manchester, Belgrade and Novi Sad and is a member of the R Forwards team and a Women in DS (WiDS) ambassador - roles dedicated to empowering women. Currently, she is the director of SisterAnalyst.org, an organisation aiming to empower women from a diverse range of backgrounds through data literacy. In addition to her involvement supporting women in STEM related activities, she is dedicated to creating an inclusive culture by developing community initiatives supporting all underrepresented groups.\nSister Analyst believes that establishing supportive communities with a cross section of data literacy skills is a necessary step in the direction of empowering women in the workplace. We are convinced that you do not need to be a maths or computer person; it is all about learning to ask the right questions when in possession of available data. Our regional STEM Networks will bring educators, business leaders, STEM professionals, and community leaders together to build success connecting STEM career opportunities within their communities.\n * In the context of the UN Resolution 1244/1999.\n","date":1632700800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632700800,"objectID":"279b9966ca9cf3121ce924dca452bb1c","permalink":"/post/getting-started/","publishdate":"2021-09-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/getting-started/","section":"post","summary":"Last week, The Regional Cooperation Council (RCC) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) assembled a group of women from Albania, Bosnia and Hercegovina, Kosovo*, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia.

The website was created in RStudio using blogdown and HUGO and deployed using GitHub and Netlify. The responses to the site were very positive and we were particularly bowled over by the wide range of backgrounds of the people wishing to attend. From economists to journalists, students to CEOs, the desire to understand more about the power of data acted as the adhesive to the collective ensemble.\nWe illustrated the process of the democratisation of open data. In the belief that we should use a topical subject for analysis, we looked at data related to air pollution in Belgrade sourced from Vazduh Gradjanima – a hot talking point within the city. We created R-Markdown reports where the participants created visual data reporting of the core issues related to air pollution. There was an amazing response to everyone being able to learn how to interact with data, as if a new world was now available to them.\nIn the spirit of transparency and reproducibility for those who were not fortunate to join us in learning how to use R and analyse this air pollution data, we uploaded our findings to the GitHub https://tanjakec.github.io/OH_workshop/OHSA.html.\n","date":1584662400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584662400,"objectID":"e321cf3d79a71202c36db7be12ff1748","permalink":"/post/oh/","publishdate":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/oh/","section":"post","summary":"Earlier in March we ran our first ever Open Heroines event here in Belgrade.\nWe got things started by creating a website publicising our event and making it clear from the get go what the participants could expect from the event.","tags":["open data","wrangling","visualisation"],"title":"Air pollution in Belgrade","type":"post"},{"authors":[""],"categories":null,"content":" Create your slides in Markdown - click the Slides button to check out the example.
