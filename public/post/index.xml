      <title>The Women in STEM Network</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rcc.int&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Regional Cooperation Council (RCC)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.undp.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)&lt;/a&gt; assembled a group of women from Albania, Bosnia and Hercegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia. The objective was to meet and work as a group as a means of establishing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rcc.int/events/1423/women-economic-empowerment-wee-launch-of-the-regional-network-of-women-in-stem&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Regional Network of Women in STEM&lt;/a&gt; (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths). The Women in STEM Network aims to expand opportunities for girls and women in educational and workplace contexts within the Western Balkans, focussing on STEM related fields. Ingrained patriarchal values and traditional culture norms are hinderances to women’s empowerment and gender equality in the Western Balkans (WB) region. This group of women are determined to address and resolve this and any other obstructions to the progress and empowerment of women in STEM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of COVID-19 resulted in a significant step backwards to recent progress regarding the reduction of gender segregation within occupations and women’s under-employment. The unequal participation in domestic duties has disproportionately impacted on the economic actualities of working women. At the same time, during the COVID-19 crises companies have accelerated their digital transformation as a crucial strategy for survival and future success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analytics and automation are absolutely key to successful digital transformation for
businesses of all sizes. The global pandemic, seismic in its impact, has both accelerated the need for robust transformation strategies and simultaneously highlighted the cracks and strains relating to gender employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recognise that the life-blood of our network is STEM education as an integrated, interdisciplinary approach to learning that provides hands-on learning experiences for students and wider communities. We see STEM teaching and learning beyond the mere transfer of knowledge. It is a mechanism for initiating and equipping learners with critical thinking, problem solving, creative and collaborative skills. This mechanism ultimately establishes interconnected relationships between work places, schools and communities and regional economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before the pandemic, organizations were struggling to recruit and retain people
with the skills needed to help them succeed in a data-driven world. Part of the
solution is to retrain current workforces into productive data analytic practitioners, which are closely STEM related. A person-centred approach is essential to success, as is infusing a culture of familiarity and expertise with data analytics overarching various organisations. Focussing on human-centred approaches makes data analytics accessible to a broader demographic, particularly women, which is now more than ever crucial in the current working environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the pandemic it has become even more obvious that in order to gain a competitive advantage in a business environment companies will have to provide an inclusive framework supporting work life balance and flexible work arrangements that attracts and retains a talented workforce and enhances women’s access to non-traditional jobs. It is very desirable to introduce certification for gender equality standards, to encourage and recognise commitment to advancing the careers of women in STEM. Certification showcases a company’s commitment to gender equality and transparency and helps to the create a cultural perception in the region of more equal and fairer society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all recognise that in addition to addressing the talent pipeline issue and encouraging more young women to pursue careers in STEM related fields, there is more industry can and should do. We have an obligation to be mutually supportive, this is the first step in countering unconscious bias and genuinely empower people. Difference is an accelerator of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s now agreed that the Women in STEM Network is going to be based on a data driven framework with the principles of equity, partnership, and sustainability. The network will seek smart, scalable solutions that lead to removing barriers and creating equitable access and opportunities for historically underserved groups of women. Gender focus is at the heart of the process of developing new programs and initiating projects as a means of closing the gender gap. Our initiative seeks to develop mechanisms of support for women as they strive to become leaders, critical thinkers, and creators. The networks created will develop new programs, projects, funding opportunities and consequently create greater opportunities for gender minorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establishing supportive communities with a cross section of data literacy skills is a necessary step in the direction of empowering women in the workplace. You don’t need to be a maths or computer person, it’s all about learning to ask the right questions when in possession of available data. Our regional STEM Networks will bring educators, business leaders, STEM professionals, and community leaders together to build success connecting STEM career opportunities within their communities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Air pollution in Belgrade</title>

&lt;script src=&#34;/rmarkdown-libs/header-attrs/header-attrs.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Earlier in March we ran our first ever &lt;a href=&#34;https://openheroines.org&#34;&gt;Open Heroines&lt;/a&gt; event here in Belgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got things started by creating &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohsa.netlify.app/&#34;&gt;a website&lt;/a&gt; publicising our event and making it clear from the get go what the participants could expect from the event. The website was created in &lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.com&#34;&gt;RStudio&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io&#34;&gt;HUGO&lt;/a&gt; and deployed using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.netlify.com&#34;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt;. The responses to the site were very positive and we were particularly bowled over by the wide range of backgrounds of the people wishing to attend. From economists to journalists, students to CEOs, the desire to understand more about the power of data acted as the adhesive to the collective ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We illustrated the process of the democratisation of open data. In the belief that we should use a topical subject for analysis, we looked at data related to air pollution in Belgrade sourced from &lt;a href=&#34;https://klimerko.org&#34;&gt;Vazduh Gradjanima&lt;/a&gt; – a hot talking point within the city. We created R-Markdown reports where the participants created visual data reporting of the core issues related to air pollution. There was an amazing response to everyone being able to learn how to interact with data, as if a new world was now available to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of transparency and reproducibility for those who were not fortunate to join us in learning how to use R and analyse this air pollution data, we uploaded our findings to the GitHub &lt;a href=&#34;https://tanjakec.github.io/OH_workshop/OHSA.html&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://tanjakec.github.io/OH_workshop/OHSA.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
