description: <div align="left">Our training programmes are primarily directed to help you to recognise the vast range of knowledge embedded within the data of 21<sup>st</sup> century digital interactions. We teach you to ‘master and speak data’ by taking a step by step approach from beginning to identify unseen details to producing visual data stories.</br><br>We deliver free part time data literacy initiatives specifically prepared for young women and those who identify as non-binary throughout the region. Principally, <b><font color="#00688B">we tailor the courses to females aged eighteen and above who may already have engaging lives or would like to change the course of their careers, or maybe have recently discovered the potential career options available in data literacy</font></b>. A typical programme of study would take part once a week for three hours over a two-month period. We strive to make the learning groups small and intimate and on completion students with good attendance who complete the required projects are presented with a certificate of completion.</br><br>The core structures of our courses of study originate from the hybrid of compounding computing and numerical skills that are difficult to develop by ‘traditional’ learning. As a consequence, we have developed a more resourceful ‘hands on’ approach to training students to think creatively about data inspired solutions. Courses are organised to suit our students’ already engaging lives.</br><br>All our courses are industry-leading, contemporary, relevant, and delivered by experts. There are two levels&#58; Module I and Module II. </br><br><b>Indicative Syllabus</b><br><b><font color="#00688B">Module I&#58;</font> Fundamentals of DS</b><ul><li>Setting up the work environment (R or Python and GitHub)&#58; record keeping</li><li>Good habits for statistical and data scientific work flows</li><li>Data classification Descriptive summary statistics</li><li>Basic statistical concepts</li><li>Data exploration</li><li>Data visualisation</li><li>Reproducible dynamic reporting</li><b>Project I&#58;</b> A case study inspired by real problems.</ul><b><font color="#00688B">Module II&#58;</font> Predictive Modelling</b><ul><li>Introduction to DA Methodology and bivariate data analysis</li><li>Common data-analysis methodology; hypothesis testing</li><li>Machine learning&#58;<ul><li>Multifactor linear regression and</li><li>Classification modelling</li></ul></li><li>Assessment of the efficacy of the fitted models using a rigorous training and testing framework</li><li>Statistical reporting</li><b>Project II&#58;</b> A case study inspired by real problems.</ul>By enrolling our courses, you will gain access to our community events and have opportunity to networking with&#58; <ul><li>inspiring women already working in the sector</li><li>like-minded people</li></ul>Through participations in our hackathons we will help you enrich your skills and develop further your portfolio. Our local and international partners provide a unique opportunity to work on real-life projects with prospects of internships and future employments. As our student you will grow your skills, build your profile, and create a platform for your data literacy empowered career.</br><br>Through our sister initiative <a href="http://klikr.rbind.io/">klikR</a>, upon completion of our training programme our students can get involved into mentoring programme to inspire the next generation of females to enter into the field of data science.</br><br>We help inspire, develop, and train you in the data literacy skills that businesses really need.</br></div>
