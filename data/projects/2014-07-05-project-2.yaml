description: <div align="left">Our training programmes are primarily directed to help you to recognise the vast range of knowledge embedded within the data of 21<sup>st</sup> century digital interactions. We teach you to ‘master and speak data’ by taking a step by step approach from beginning to identify unseen details to producing visual data stories.</br><br>As part of our course ensemble, we deliver free part time data literacy initiatives specifically prepared for young women and those who identify as non-binary throughout the region. Principally, we tailor the courses to females aged eighteen and above who may already have engaging lives or would like to change the course of their careers or maybe have recently discovered the potential career options available in data literacy. A typical programme of study would take part once a week for three hours over a two-month period. We strive to make the learning groups small and intimate and on completion students with seventy five percent attendance who complete the required projects are presented with a certificate of completion.</br><br>The core structures of our courses of study originate from the hybrid of compounding computing and numerical skills that are difficult to develop by ‘traditional’ learning. As a consequence, we have developed a more resourceful ‘hands on’ approach to training students to think creatively about data inspired solutions.</br><br><b>Training &#58; Empowering women throughout their Data Literacy Journey.</b> Sister Analyst runs free part-time data literacy courses for young women/university students across the region who identify as women/non-binary <b>age 18+ who are currently studying or have recently completed their studies.</b></br><br>The courses are organised to suit our students’ already engaging lives. Our courses last two months and the classes are run once a week in the evenings for 3 hours in the groups with maximum of 25 students. To obtain the certificate students are expected to complete the assignment projects with minimum of 75% attendance.</br><br>There are two levels courses&#58; Module I and Module II</br></div>
