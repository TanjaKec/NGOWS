description: <div align="left"><br>Our initiatives are directed to facilitating a deeper understanding of what data science can bring to communal life. In addition to this we aim to create wider communities by connecting people through new and established forums and DS networks. Our community strategies are primarily geared to connecting girls in higher education and motivated professional women to engage with the career and personal opportunities that DS can advance.</br><br>We predominately organise small scale events with emphasis on mentoring programmes to inspire the next generation of females to enter into the field of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).  We are committed to fostering greater inclusivity and gender diversity, but also through our <a href="http://klikr.rbind.io">klikR</a> project we identify and help disadvantaged children who may not be able to access relevant materials or experience difficult learning surroundings outside of ‘traditional’ education institutions.</br><br>We encourage and support women to participate in substantive technical and professional conversations in a positive, supportive environment. Through a series of panel events such as, hackathons, exhibitions, and mentoring schemes, our programs help women build data literacy confidence and also maximise their presence in their professional lives and local and regional communities. We host workshops designed to inspire and motivate women, as well as organize training strategies to teach and refine data skills.</br><br>If you would like the opportunity to become a fellow traveller on our journey, please get in touch to join us and participate in one of our events.</br></div>
