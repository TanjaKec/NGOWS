description: <div align="left"><br>We like to keep things simple and we like to help. In common with many, we would like the world to be better and we try to make a difference. Our mission is founded on the belief that everyone has the right to have a chance in life. We would like that to mean something, a world where you have chance to make your mark irrespective of your gender or social background. This is our motivation.</br><br>The relatively new professions of Data Science (DS) and Data Analytics (DA) are not simply fashionable jargon, but rather disciplines with a set of tools that empower data enriched living. They are hybrid of compounding computing and numerical skills that may be difficult to develop in traditional training programs. Consequently, new generations of students need to be introduced to the discipline from an early age.</br><br>As the amount of ‘big’ Data increases there is a knock-on requirement for these facts and figures to be scrutinised, organised and presented in as clear and concise format as possible, this is the job of the Data Scientist. IBM predicts that demand for data scientists will increase 28% by 2020 and there is a great concern that supply of data science professionals is lagging dangerously behind demand. To meet this explosive demand, governments, businesses would be wise to rethink hiring, training, and partnership initiatives. Education and training systems need to adopt a more agile approach in responding to workforce needs that will prepare a future work force for analytics-related roles, while existing workers need to continuously enhance their analytical and technological skills.</br><br>We believe that recognising the potential of data to making life better is the first step of a process. With our help and support anyone with ability and the desire can achieve their goals within a discipline with a capacity to make things better.</div>
