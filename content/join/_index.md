Sister Analyst is an organisation that promotes diversity in the DS and AI Community.</br>
<br>
Our goal is to help more women and people from gender minority groups to flourish in their careers through the application and practice of data skills. We help women and gender minority groups from any social background to enter the rapidly expanding world of data. We do that by providing direct support, advocacy, and community development.</br>
<br>
Together, we are building a community to make Data Science and Artificial Intelligence more inclusive to everyone.
